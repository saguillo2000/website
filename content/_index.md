My passion for Computer Science and Economics has led me into the explore of MEV and blockchain protocols. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things and connect with people from around the world.

I particularly enjoy research and engineering complex systems. Currently, Iâ€™m learning Rust ðŸ¦€ to build efficient bots for MEV, playing Poker and improving investing strategies.

Iâ€™m also working towards becoming an expert in protocol research, I will start next year as a PhD student at IMDEA Networks under the supervision of Dr. Lucianna Kiffer.
