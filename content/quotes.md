I like quotes, and I'm going to post the most beautiful ones to keep track of them.

- "Sometimes the people who no one imagines anything of are the ones who do the things that no one can imagine." — *Alan Turing*
- "Even in the darkest nights, the sun will always appear." — *(Victor Hugo, Les Misérables)*
- "Life is a set of emotions, and we are the result of them." — *Myself*
