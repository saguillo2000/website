I like quotes, and I'm going to post the most beautiful ones to keep track of them.

- "Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of, who do the things that no one can imagine." — *Alan Turing*
- "Even in the darkest nights, the sun will always appear." — *(Victor Hugo, Les Misérables)*
- "Life is a set of emotions, and we are the result of them." — *Myself*
- “When does a man die? When he is hit by a bullet? No! When he suffers a disease? No! When he ate a soup made out of a poisonous mushroom? No! A man dies when he is forgotten!” - (Eiichiro Oda, One Piece)
- "The Best Time To Start Was Yesterday. The Second-Best Time Is Now."
- “The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty.” (James Clear)
