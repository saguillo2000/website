      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-talent&#34;&gt;What is talent?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I hear people saying that someone has incredible talent in a particular area, and they feel they can’t compare. Of course, there are individuals with extraordinary abilities—like Magnus Carlsen, Lionel Messi, or top-level athletes. But does that mean you’re talentless? I’ve started to believe this mindset is often an excuse to justify laziness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Malcolm Gladwell, in his book Outliers, discusses the “10,000-hour rule” required to master any skill. This got me thinking: talent might be like the learning rate (alpha) in gradient descent models in machine learning. You might be more or less naturally suited for a particular skill, but ultimately, mastery still demands time and effort. As UFC champion Khabib Nurmagomedov once said, “Hard work beats talent when talent doesn&amp;rsquo;t work hard.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
